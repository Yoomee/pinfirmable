# Pinfirmable
A replacement for Devise `confirmable` to use a pin rather than an emailed link to confirm a users email. (Inspired by Slack)

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pinfirmable'
```
And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```
Add the `pinfirmable` module to your devise model (e.g User)
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise :database_authenticatable,
         :registerable,
         ...
         :pinfirmable
```
```bash
rake db:migrate
# If your devise model isn't called user
rake db:migrate MODEL=admin
```
Add the javascript include to the asset pipeline.
```
//= require pinfirmable
```

## Skip Emails

To skip the pinfirmable email when creating a user (e.g. when seeding a database) the `skip_pinfirmation!` method is available
 
 ```
 user = User.new
 # setup the user
 user.skip_pinfirmation!
 user.save
 ```

## Development set up

Check out the project and then run
```bash
rake db:setup
```
To create and migrate a development and test database.

Run ```rspec``` to run the tests.

## Todo
 - Encrypt the pin in the DB
